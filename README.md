An attempt at a cleaner version of [sqlcmdline](https://github.com/sebasmonia/sqlcmdline/). Unlike that tool, this one doesn't try to mimic [sqlcmd](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/tools/sqlcmd-utility) and instead is built from scratch to be compatible with more DB engines. It also pip-installable from this repository.
